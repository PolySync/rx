## Overview

Rx is a DSL that extends Markdown for the purpose of defining a document in
terms of constraints on its structure and content. An Rx file can then be used
to validate the conformance of other plain markdown documents to the generic
document definition.

[CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/) is a formal specification of
Markdown and is the specific standard that Rx extends. A valid CommonMark file
is also a valid Rx file and in the context of Rx, describes a document that must
match identically. In addition to this **Literal** type of specification, Rx
provides the three tokens `-!!-`, `-??-`, and `-""-` which indicate **Mandatory**,
**Optional**, and **Repeatable** respectively. CommonMark conceptualizes a markdown
document as consisting of block and inline elements and the exact meaning of the Rx
tokens is dependent on the type of Markdown element it is used in conjunction
with.

## Usage

### Inline Elements

In CommonMark, inline elements contain textual content and formatting context.
In addition to plain textual content, they include things such as links, inline
code snippets, emphasis, etc. The full list of element types can be viewed in
the [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/#inlines).

Rx tokens that appear in the context of inline elements represent prompts for
arbitrary textual content to appear according to token type.

* **Literal**
    Any textual content that is not an Rx token or a syntactic element of
    Markdown must be matched with an identical section of text.

* `-!!-`
    **Mandatory**

    Some content must be inserted here. Each mandatory token must match with at
    least one non-whitespace characters, so adjacent mandatory tokens must be
    matched with content whose length is greater than or equal to the number of
    tokens.

* `-??-`
    **Optional**

    Some content may be inserted here, but is not necessary for the document to
    be considered valid.

* `-""-`
    **Repeatable**

    Has no signifigance in this context. Is not considered a valid usage of this
    token.

### Inline Examples

#### Matching Literals

##### Rx

```markdown
# A Heading

Some content.
```

##### Matches

```markdown
# A Heading

Some content.
```

##### Rejects

```markdown
Literally anything else.
```

#### Matching Mandatory tokens

##### Rx

```markdown
# We're off to see -!!-

The -!!- of -!!-.
```

##### Matches

```markdown
# We're off to see the wizard

The wonderful wizard of Oz.
```

```markdown
# We're off to see the veterinarian

The priciest doctor of dogs.
```

```markdown
# We're off to see the optometrist

The optometrist will tell us if we are in need of glasses.
```

##### Rejects

```markdown
# We're off to see

The dentist because our teeth are full of cavities.
```

> In this case, the Mandatory token in the heading has not been satisfied.

#### Matching Optional Tokens

##### Rx

```markdown
Seeking a -??-qualified applicant for our remote -??- offices.
```

##### Matches

```markdown
Seeking a woefully unqualified applicant for our remote customer support offices.
```

```markdown
Seeking a qualified applicant for our remote offices.
```

##### Rejects

```markdown
Seeking a marginally qualified applicant for our remote call center.
```
> An inline Optional token cannot by itself cause a mismatch since it can match
> any textual content or nothing. In this case the mismatch is triggered by the
> Literal content `offices` being omitted.

#### Matching Links

##### Rx

```markdown
Please [visit](https:://-!!-.polysync.io) us on the web!
```

##### Matches

```markdown
Please [visit](https:://www.polysync.io) us on the web!
```

```markdown
Please [visit](https:://www.rx.polysync.io) us on the web!
```

##### Rejects

```markdown
Please [visit](https:://.polysync.io) us on the web!
```

> Rejected because there was no prefix specified in the uri.

```markdown
Please [visit](http:://scam.polysync.io) us on the web!
```

> Rejected because the `s` was omitted from the protocol portion of the uri.

### Block Elements

In CommonMark, block elements are categorized into container blocks and leaf
blocks. Leaf blocks such as Paragraphs or Headings contain inline elements.
Container blocks such as List Items or Block Quotes can contain both leaf blocks
and other container blocks. The full description of blocks elements and
their types is available in the [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/#container-blocks-and-leaf-blocks).

In Rx, block elements can be annotated with an Rx token to indicate a
block-level matching rule. The placement of the token is usually at the
beginning of the element on its own line, but varies slightly depending
on the element type due to the constraints of CommonMark syntax. See the
[Block Element Annotation](#block-element-annotation-examples) section below for examples
of token placement for each different element type.

Block elements with block-level tokens can also be classified as being
**Explicit**, or **Wildcard** types. Explicit types contain additional content,
whereas Wildcard types contain just the block-level token annotation.

The match constraints imposed by block-level tokens are as follows.

* **Literal**

    A Literal Block Element is a block element without a block-level Rx token.
    Literal elements are implicitly mandatory and all their contained elements
    must match according to their individual match constraints in order for the
    block as a whole to match.

* `-!!-`
    **Mandatory**

    - **Explicit:**

        In order to match, a block element of the same type **must** appear in
        this position in the matching document. In addition, all contained
        block elements contained within the scope of this element must also be
        matched according to their relevant matching rules.

    - **Wildcard:**

        In order to match, a block element of the same type **must** appear in
        this position in the document however, it may contain any number of
        arbitrary internal elements.

* `-??-`
    **Optional**

    - **Explicit:**

        In order to match, a block element of the same type **may** appear in
        this position in the matching document but is not necessary for the
        document as a whole to match. If the element does appear, all contained
        elements must also be matched according to their respective constraints.

    - **Wildcard**

        In order to match, a block element of the same type **may** appear in
        this position in the document, but is not necessary. If the element does
        appear, it may contain any number of arbitrary internal elements.

* `-""-`
    **Repeatable**

    A block element may be specified as repeatable by placing an empty element
    of the same type immediately following it that is annotated with a
    block-level repeatable token. This indicates that any number of elements
    that match the repeatable element **may** appear at this position in the
    document. The matching constraints of the element marked as repeatable must
    still be adhered to however, i.e. if it is marked as mandatory, then at
    least one matching element must be present.
